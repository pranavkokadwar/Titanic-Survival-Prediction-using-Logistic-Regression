# Logistic_Regression
# Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 🛳 Project Overview
This project is a **binary classification** model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, class, and family relationships aboard. The model is built using **Python** and **Logistic Regression**.  

The project also includes a **Streamlit web app** to interactively test predictions.

## 📋 Dataset
- The dataset used is the famous **Titanic dataset**  
- Key features include:
  - `Pclass` – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
  - `Sex` – Gender
  - `Age` – Age of passenger
  - `SibSp` – Number of siblings/spouses aboard
  - `Parch` – Number of parents/children aboard
  - `Embarked` – Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
- Target variable:
  - `Survived` – 0 = No, 1 = Yes
